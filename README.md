# Video-Stabilizer

Calibrates the shaking of the video. The final goal is to remove shaking from the driving video of the vehicle.
Code is not perfect.

The video was obtained from kaggle.

The graph below shows the degree of up-and-down shaking of the image before and after the calibration.

Calibration cannot be effective for all situations. In some images, the corrected image is rather more shaky.
This issue needs to be resolved.

The code will continue to be revised and written.
